# Statistics Homework Repository

Welcome to the Statistics Homework repository. This collection of Jupyter Notebook files contains small data analyses written for my university statistics lab classes. Each notebook provides insights and statistical analyses on different datasets to further your understanding of statistical concepts.

## Jupyter Notebook Files

This repository contains the following Jupyter Notebook files:

1. **cauchy.ipynb**: A small data analysis exploring a dataset related to a specific statistical concept.

2. **exponential.ipynb**: Another analysis showcasing a different statistical concept.

3. **hypothesis_test.ipynb**: Yet another analysis focusing on a unique aspect of statistics.

4. **probability.ipynb**: And the last analysis focusing on a probability.

Feel free to explore these notebooks to gain insights into various statistical techniques and their practical applications.

## Profit Analysis

Additionally, this repository includes a folder named `profit_analysis`. Inside this folder, you'll find the following files:

1. **CompanyProfit.xlsx**: The dataset in Excel format containing company profit data from the year 1821 to 2022. This data has been sourced from Kaggle.

2. **p1.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook performing a small data analysis of the company's profit dataset. This analysis aims to provide insights into the trends and patterns of the company's profit over time.

## Usage

To explore the analyses and profit analysis:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/natrand/statistics-hw.git`.

2. Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd statistics-hw`.

3. For the profit analysis, go to the `profit_analysis` folder: `cd profit_analysis`.

4. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`.

6. Open the desired `.ipynb` files and run each cell sequentially to replicate the analyses.
